description=Sagewood is a "little big city" seemingly in the middle of nowhere Kentucky. When billionaire Edelton Sagewood was denied the purchase of Knox County he went ahead and bought a blank plot of land near the zig zag road west of March Ridge and south of the small town of Muldraugh. People thought he was insane when he suggested creating a little big city to rival that of not only Louiville, but of other great cities like New York, Miami, Chicago, Austin, and Los Angeles.

description=Money poured in and when the first bowling alley below towering apartment buildings went up, people thought the sight was hilarious, unnatural, and somehow, gravitational. People from all over Kentucky started pouring into this new city. With so much supply, prices to buy were low and first-time buyers from all over the country flocked to the Sagewood haven!

description=It's a small place, filled with TONS of people, lots of shops, anything you could wish for, and the famous Sagewood Park made to rival that of Central Park in New York and Balboa Park in San Diego. Sagewood welcomes everyone from all walks of life and lots of apartments are open for sale! Come buy yourself a piece of Sagewood and get into a big city while the prices are low. All the big brands are opening shop here, from Fossoil to Spiffos.

description=The city might have gotten even bigger if it didn't go into lockdown due to some strange sickness that seemed to be ravaging the world. Everyone already lived through one major pandemic, it's not like the next one could end the world...
